As the title suggests there were some problems in the script that
launched the qemu instance. This post is trying to get solve that
problem.

When launching the qemu instance you might have observed the fact that
there you were not able to run smoothly any command and the password
promt or the login one just showed up over and over again.

It seems that there were 2 instances of the "getty" process that just
got bits an pieces from what you were typing and never enough to make a
proper login.

I chose to solve this issue by redirecting the output from the virtual
machine into the host terminal so that you do not have to deal with
another window or any login problems.

The revised script is below:


    #! /bin/sh

    brctl addbr br0
    ip addr add 192.168.5.4/24 broadcast 192.168.5.255 dev br0
    ip link set br0 up

    ip tuntap add dev tap0 mode tap
    ip link set tap0 up promisc on

    brctl addif br0 tap0

    qemu-system-x86_64  -M pc -m 1024 -no-reboot \
    -nographic \
    -kernel boot_files/bzImage  -append "console=ttyS0,115200 highres=off \
    root=/dev/sda rootfstype=ext3" \
    -hda  boot_files/rootfs.img \
    -net nic,macaddr="52:54:be:36:42:a9" -net tap,ifname=tap0,script=no,downscript=no

    ip link set br0 down
    brctl delbr br0

    ip link set tap0 down
    ip link delete tap0



Thanks again.

See you next time.
