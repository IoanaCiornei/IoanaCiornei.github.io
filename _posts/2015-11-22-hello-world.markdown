Hi, I am Ioana and for the next 3 months I will be an intern at the Linux
Foundation through the Outreachy program.

After the application period, that lasted for about 1 mounth, I have
been selected to work closely with Alex Elder and the Ceph community.

This blog was created with the main intent to keep you informed about the my
progress during this internship.
